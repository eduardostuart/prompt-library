# Prompt Library

> Inspired by [@goossaert/prompt-library](https://github.com/goossaert/prompt-library).

The key difference is that this library also stores your prompts as GitHub gists, allowing you to share them across multiple devices.

> Generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini Pro 2.5 (Experimental).
>
> A copy from @goosaert screenshot and GitHub gist instructions.

> ðŸ˜… I couldn't generate everything using Claude (limit reached), but Gemini was able to finalize.

Open the `index.html` file using your browser, and you should be able to create, authenticate, sync, etc.
Stored locally and on gists - private to you - (if you sign in).
