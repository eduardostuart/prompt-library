# Prompt Library

> Inspired by [@goossaert/prompt-library](https://github.com/goossaert/prompt-library).

The key difference is that this library also stores your prompts as GitHub gists, allowing you to share them across multiple devices.

> Generated using Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini Pro 2.5 (Experimental).

Just open the `index.html` file using your browser, and you should be able to create, authenticate, sync, etc.
